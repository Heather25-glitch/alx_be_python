# Define variables
principal = 1000  # principal amount in dollars
rate = 0.05       # annual interest rate as a decimal (5%)
time = 3          # time in years

# Calculate the simple interest using the formula I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated interest
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
